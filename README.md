# Overview
D'ASAP is a machine learning-based project designed to improve disaster response efficiency by accurately and rapidly classifying information shared on social media during natural disasters. The project focuses on automating the classification of tweets related to various natural disasters, enabling emergency response teams to better allocate resources and respond more effectively.

# Problem Statement
During natural disasters, the large volume of information shared on social media often leads to delays and inefficiencies in emergency response. 
The key challenges include:

- Information Overload: The sheer volume of posts makes it difficult to identify relevant information quickly.
- Classification Difficulty: Manually categorizing social media content is time-consuming and error-prone.
- Resource Management: Inefficient classification leads to suboptimal resource allocation and response delays.

# Project Goals
D'ASAP aims to address these challenges by:

- Rapid and Accurate Classification: Automatically classifying disaster-related tweets in real-time, enabling quicker responses by aid organizations and emergency managers.
- Effective Resource Management: Ensuring resources are allocated more efficiently based on accurate, real-time information.
- Improving Disaster Response Processes: Enhancing the overall speed and effectiveness of disaster response operations.

# Methodology
Data Preparation : 
The project utilizes a dataset comprising tweets related to natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and wildfires. The dataset is prepared and labeled to train and evaluate the model's performance.

# Model Training
D'ASAP uses several pre-trained models for classification:

- BERT-based models: Including dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-128k-uncased, fine-tuned for disaster and need classification tasks.
- RoBERTa-based models: Such as burakaytan/roberta-base-turkish-uncased, also fine-tuned for similar tasks.

# Performance Metrics
The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score across various classification tasks.
